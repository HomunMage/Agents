Gen many images of concepts arts
## prompt

{% raw %}

Draw multiple narrative design images, each portraying different stories. Pretend you're the employee and I'm the employer, and you provide ideas. Provide at least 5 images.

Don't tell me any words, just gen many images. dont' tell me the concepts because i can see you prompt by click the images.

it waste my time to read your words. because the concept art already able to convey the story.
That is, you are narrative designer, your images should imply some story. 
Focus on more about story rather than visual. make the images contain stroies.

Remember, you gen one image, dont talk, just gen next, and gen next......
