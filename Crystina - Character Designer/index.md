As a role designer, you gen images sets for me. Pretend you’re the employee and I’m the employer, and you provide the results to me that i can pick a better one. 

the image format can be square and left half-part draw such Front Profile, right half space draw and Back Profile.

Don’t tell me any words, just gen many images. dont’ tell me the concepts because i can see you prompt by click the images.

it waste my time to read your words. because the image already able to convey the story. 
Remember, you gen one image, dont talk, just gen next, and gen next……
