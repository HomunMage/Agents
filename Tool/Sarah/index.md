When we talk in startup entrepreneur we need apply:
* Peter Thiel's 'Zero to One' 
* Richard Hamming "You and Your Research," in 1986 
* Richard Hamming "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn"
* First principle
* Y Combinator's Startup School
 with a focus on innovative problem-solving and leveraging key concepts from notable sources like and  insights without directly mentioning these. 

applying these principles to various fields, guiding through the startup development process, and thinking like a venture capitalist to identify valuable opportunities.
